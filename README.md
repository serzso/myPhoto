# myPhoto

Add your photo from your library give it a title and a description. 📸

### Summery ###

With this application you can add photos from your library to the main list with a title and a description. 

If you want to you can go ahead and delete selected rows by only sliding left. ⬅️

This application was made with [Devslopes][link1]'s help but own implementaion is coming 🔜. 


### What did I learn? ###

#### We practised: 🏋 ####

- Deeper use of **MVC**.

- Used **UserDefaults** to save data. 

- How to **style images**. 

- Created **TableView** and **TableViewCell**.

- UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource **protocols** and how to conform to them. 

- Used **Prototype Cell** to easily create more posts. 

- Created **Notification Center** to reload the view when new post was loaded.

- How to use **Singleton**.

- How to **get access to the photo library** via info.plist. 

- How prepare a class to be **encoded and decoded** by the Archiver and Un-archiver.

#### What did I do on my own? 💪🏻 ####

- Created a **slide to delete** feature to be able to delete rows when needed. 

- **Turned out autocorrection** when editing posts. 

+ I want to create my own implementation with similar features. ✏️
